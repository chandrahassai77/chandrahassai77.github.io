This is My personal Portfolio website, I have downloaded the template and customized all the matter to brief myself. 

I've put 5 sections

Social media mini icon links to my personal respective social media ids.

Home which just contains a pic of mine annd bried intro iof what I am.

About section where I put up all my personal details

Portfolio section where I dumbed some of the photos clicked by me along with the link to git repo that has a mini fifa terminal pack opening simulator.

Contact section which has details to contact me.

I have used git branch command to implement each of the above sections seperately and commits in each branch I have named the branches and commits accordingly so that it will be easier to identify the commits made in respective branches.
